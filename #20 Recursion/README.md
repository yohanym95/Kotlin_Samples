### Lesson 20 - Recursion

This Demo code is to show how to use recursion in Kotlin. This is how to calculate the factorial of a given number.

*Recursion is method which a function calls it self. We use recursion method basicaly instead of loops.*

There's a problem. Wecan't find a very big factorial with an Int variable. So we have to use BigInteger. Demo Big code is to show how to use BigInteger.
